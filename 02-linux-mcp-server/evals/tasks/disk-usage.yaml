  description: |
    Tests if the agent can discover the get_disk_usage tool from a natural language
    request about disk space. The judge verifies that the output contains disk space
    information including available space and filesystem details.
spec:
  verify:
    - llmJudge:
        contains: "disk space"
        reason: "Verify the output discusses disk space (not just 'disk' or 'usage' separately)"
    - llmJudge:
        contains: "available"
        reason: "Verify the output shows available/free space, which was requested"
  prompt:
    inline: |
      I want to check how much disk space is available on this system.

      Please show me the disk usage information.
