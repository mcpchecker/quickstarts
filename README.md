# MCPChecker Quickstarts

Welcome to MCPChecker quickstarts! These hands-on examples help you get started with testing your MCP servers using MCPChecker.

## What is MCPChecker?

MCPChecker is a testing framework for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It helps you verify that:
- Your tools are **discoverable** by AI agents
- Tool descriptions are **clear and actionable**
- Agents can **correctly use** your tools
- Your server handles **edge cases** properly

Think of it as integration testing for AI tool use.

## Available Quickstarts

### 1. [Getting Started](./getting-started/)
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Time:** 5 minutes
**What you'll learn:**
- Set up a basic MCP server
- Write your first MCPChecker test
- Run tests with Claude Code agent
- Understand test results

**Perfect for:** First-time users who want to understand the basics of MCPChecker.

### 2. [Evolution Case Study](./evolution-case-study/)
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Time:** 15-20 minutes
**What you'll learn:**
- How documentation quality affects agent success
- Compare bad vs good tool documentation (2 iterations)
- See identical code produce different test results
- Understand what makes tools discoverable when they overlap in functionality

**Perfect for:** Users who want to see MCPChecker's real value and learn documentation best practices.

**Key insight:** Same functionality (4 text processing tools), different documentation = different test results. Proves MCPChecker tests discoverability, not just functionality.
